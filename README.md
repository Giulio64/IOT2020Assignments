The following repo contains all the code and resources utilized in the 2020 IOT 1^st Homework/Assignment:

"In this assignment you will create a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol. You will also create a simple web site to display the data collected from the sensors."

The project model a distributed system where a number of einvoirmental stations connected to five different sensors:

temperature (-50 ... 50 Celsius),
humidity (0 ... 100%),
wind direction (0 ... 360 degrees),
wind intensity (0 ... 100 m/s),
rain height (0 ... 50 mm / h),

sending data to a central hub.
